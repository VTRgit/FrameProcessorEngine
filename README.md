# Project: Real-Time Frame Processing Engine

This project is a real-time frame processing engine designed to simplify the implementation of multiple processing tasks on each frame from one or more video streams. Its purpose is to maximize machine resource utilization by enabling parallel execution of algorithms and GPU-dependent processes, enhancing the efficiency of computer vision algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Custom Task Definition**: Allows for defining custom tasks to process frames, with the goal of synchronizing results and ensuring real-time responses.
- **High-Volume Data Processing**: Particularly useful for applications that require fast and coordinated processing of large volumes of video data.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Enables parallel execution of algorithms and GPU-dependent tasks for optimal machine resource utilization.

## Technical Overview

The project is built on **C++20 coroutines** and follows **real-time programming guidelines**, ensuring optimal performance in high-demand contexts and minimizing data processing latency.
